Open this post in raw [on github](https://github.com/Bizzby/bizzby.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2015-01-27-read-me.md) first. See that crap at the top of the page? That's YAML front-matter. There are three important keys up there: `layout`, `title`, and `author`. All three are required. You'll always want the `layout` to be `post`. Always.

Here's some rules:

1. Try not to use `<h1>`s in the markdown. It ruins the type heirarchy as a `<h1>` will look like a title to a new post.
1. Don't know how to write markdown? Go read [the original docs](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), then read [these docs](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) as we use Github-flavoured markdown that has extra fanciness built in.
1. There is no third rule

# Don't put `h1`s in posts because it looks dumb. Also, if you do write headings, make them short — not stupid and long like this one.

Do feel free to use *`<em>`phasis* and **`<strong>`ness**. It makes it a bit more interesting to read. Don't go crazy tho.

You can add images if you like:

![i like to read](http://bukk.it/reading.jpg)

And even gifs:

![follow your dreams always](http://bukk.it/remembermeeeeeeee.gif)

Images that are quite wide will fit juuuuuust fine:
